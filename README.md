## Body Mass Index Calculator

This project is developed in a kotlin bootcamp that I'm participating at [DIO](https://digitalinnovation.one/).

The objective of this project is to develop a BMI calculator where the user can choose between the Imperial and Metric measurement systems to calculate their BMI.
